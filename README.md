Python Dependencies (Pose Planning):
pybullet
scipy
numpy 
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter notebook 

Geometric Pre-Processing Pipeline utilizes the scripts: 
ConvexDecompositionVHACD.py
RockMeshToSingleRockMeshes.py
Docker is required to run the pre-processing pipeline and details on how to do so exist within the shell files in the root directory. However, I have included all the static assets generated by the pipeline in the "Rocks" directory. 

The main entrypoint is either a jupyter notebook or a python script
stonestacking.ipynb
stonestacking.py

Running the script / Running all cells in the notebook will reproduce the experiment detailed in the project report.
